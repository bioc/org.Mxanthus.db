CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.17
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o This is the first version of the package. The principal purpose of the package is to obtain a orgDb object that stores
    the genome wide annotation for Myxococcus xanthus DK 1622. As all orgDb packages, it allows to do simples queries, more
    complex SQL queries with DBI and enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler. The principal advantage of this package is that
    the data is stored in AnnotationHub, so the user do not need to download and store it with the package.
